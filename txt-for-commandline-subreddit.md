TITLE: Free Linux commandline "upskill" course starting shortly...

This free month-long course is re-starting again on the first Monday of next month.

Daily lessons appear in the sub-reddit r/linuxupskillchallenge - which is also used for support/discussion.

Has been running successfully now every month since February 2020 - more detail at: https://LinuxUpskillChallenge.org

As you'll see, it's aimed at those wanting to admin servers, but 100% of the content is classic Linux commandline stuff just as applicable to a desktop user.
