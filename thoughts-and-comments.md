# Questions and chat, Day X...

Posting your questions, chat etc. here keeps things tidier...

Your contribution will 'live on' longer too, because we delete lessons after 4-5 days - along with their comments.

(By the way, if _you_ can answer a query, please feel free to chip in. While Steve, (@snori74), is the official tutor, he's on a different timezone than most, and sometimes busy, unwell or on holiday!)
